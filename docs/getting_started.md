# Getting Started with QCA-Core

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: Version control system for cloning the repository. Install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Basic Understanding**: Familiarity with quantum computing concepts will be beneficial.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the QCA-Core project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   
```bash
1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/QCA-Core.git
2 cd QCA-Core
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**: It’s a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using:

```bash
1 python -m venv venv
2 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Required Packages**: Install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
1 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

To run the main application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
1 python src/main.py
```

## Example Usage

Here’s a simple example of how to use the QCA-Core algorithms. This example demonstrates quantum key distribution (QKD):

```python
1 from src.algorithms.cryptography.qkd import qkd
2 
3 # Define the key size for QKD
4 key_size = 128
5 
6 # Execute the QKD algorithm
7 result = qkd(key_size)
8 
9 # Print the generated key
10 print("Generated Quantum Key:", result)
```

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during installation or while running the project, consider the following:

-**Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed correctly. You can reinstall them using:

```bash
1 pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

- **Python Version**: Verify that you are using the correct version of Python. You can check your Python version with:

```bash
1 python --version
```

- **Common Errors**: If you receive specific error messages, search for them in the project's issue tracker or consult the community for assistance.
