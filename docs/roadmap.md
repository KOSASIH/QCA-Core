# QCA-Core Roadmap

## Current Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Complete initial implementations of algorithms for cryptography and drug discovery (Q1 2024).
- **Phase 2**: Develop optimization algorithms and benchmarking tools (Q2 2024).
- **Phase 3**: Release version 1.0 with comprehensive documentation and examples (Q3 2024).

## Future Goals
- Expand the library to include more quantum algorithms.
- Enhance performance benchmarks and comparisons with classical algorithms.
- Foster community engagement through workshops and collaborative projects.

## Feedback
We welcome feedback on our roadmap and any suggestions for future features!
